# Nomad
A travel planner allowing users to find random cities around their trip's starting point, with the main activities to do in these spots and the estimated cost for accommodation, transport and daily life. Once a city is added to the trip it suggests you a new city to explore around the previous one. Once the trip is finalized it redirects to the trip's overview and the overall cost. The user can also access all of its trips, cities explored and activities experienced.
